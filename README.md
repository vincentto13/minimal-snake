## Mini C++ Snake
This is a try to write minimal Snake game (best known from old cellphones) written in C++. The code
still can be shrinked but as for now its:

```sh
> wc snake.min.cpp
  8  25 669 snake.min.cpp
  
> tr -d '[:space:] ' < snake.min.cpp | wc -c
644
```

It was inspired by (found somewhere in the internet) C+64 version of snake. Mine is not that small... yet ::blink::
